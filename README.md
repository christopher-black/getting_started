#### QUESTION
*How would you explain Git to your Grandparents?*
Git is a way of keeping a historical record of code. You can think of this like using a bank account ledger for your checking account. At the end of the day your balance is the most important thing but in the event of a discrepancy, you want a historical record of each transaction. Understanding money in and out is a critical component to good budgeting. Similarly, keeping track of each line of code added or removed, is a critical component to successful websites.
